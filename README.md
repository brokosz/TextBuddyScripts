# TextBuddyScripts

This repository is for my custom scripts for [TextBuddy](https://textbuddy.app/), a Mac app by Tyler Hall. Some created by me, many converted from Boop scripts and other javascript examples found on the interwebs.

To use the scripts, open TextBuddy and choose __Scripts->Open Scripts Folder__ from the menu. Save any script from this repository to that folder (ensuring that the extension is `.js`).

Once a script is located in that folder, it can be run in TextBuddy using `âŒ˜R`.
